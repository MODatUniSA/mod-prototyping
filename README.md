## What is MOD. ?

[MOD. at the University of South Australia](https://mod.org.au/about/) will be Australia’s leading future-focused museum, provoking new ideas at the intersection of science, art and innovation. MOD. aims to inspire young adults aged 15+ about science and technology with dynamic, changing exhibition programs, showcasing how research shapes our understanding of the world to inform future possibilities.

One of our design principals is to be **Unexpected and audacious** - experiences will be emotionally charged, where science and technology can be fun, but also challenging, icky and delightful. 

To help achieve this goal, we’ll prototype a bunch of things in-house: soft-robots, sensors, machine learning, mobile apps and projections.
